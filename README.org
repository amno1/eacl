Auto complete lines by grepping the project.

For example, a web developer need create a new component instance.

Suppose the component is used in current project before:
#+begin_src html
<MyComponent
  attr1="v1"
  attr2="v2"
  attr3="v3"
  attr4="v4"
/>
  <Toolbar>
    <Button onClick={ e => console.log(e) }>
      <i className="fa fa-circle" />
    </Button>
  </Toolbar>
</MyComponent>
#+end_src

The developer only need input =<MyComponent= and run =M-x eacl-complete-multiline=.
* Install
Place =eacl.el= under your [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LoadPath][Load Path]]. Then add =(require 'eacl)= to your configuration.

It's also possible to use [[http://melpa.org][melpa]].

=git grep= is automatically detected for completion if possible. Or else default grep is used.

To use =git grep=, Git should be added into environment variable "PATH".

The command line program of grep and git need be added into environment variable "PATH". Or else you need set =eacl-grep-program= and =eacl-git-program= to specify their path.
* Usage
=M-x eacl-complete-line= completes single line. Line candidates are extracted from the project root.

=M-x eacl-complete-multiline= completes multiline code or html tag in project

=C-u M-x eacl-complete-line= completes single line from *deleted code* if current project is tracked by Git.

The keyword to grep is the text from the line beginning to current cursor.

Whitespace in keyword matches any characters.

The project root is *automatically* detected if Git/Mercurial/Subversion is used.

You can override the default root directory by setting =eacl-project-root=,
#+begin_src elisp
(setq eacl-project-root "~/projs/PROJECT_DIR")
#+end_src
* Tips
** Directories and files to ignore
Modify =grep-find-ignored-directories= and =grep-find-ignored-files= to setup directories and files grep should ignore:
#+begin_src elisp
(with-eval-after-load 'grep
  (dolist (v '("node_modules"
               "bower_components"
               ".sass_cache"
               ".cache"
               ".npm"))
    (add-to-list 'grep-find-ignored-directories v))
  (dolist (v '("*.min.js"
               "*.bundle.js"
               "*.min.css"
               "*.json"
               "*.log"))
    (add-to-list 'grep-find-ignored-files v)))
#+end_src

Or you can setup above ignore options in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html][.dir-locals.el]].

Sample of =.dir-locals.el=,
#+begin_src elisp
((nil . ((eval . (progn
                   (dolist (v '("node_modules"
                                "bower_components"
                                ".sass_cache"
                                ".cache"
                                ".npm"))
                     (add-to-list 'grep-find-ignored-directories v))
                   (dolist (v '("*.min.js"
                                "*.bundle.js"
                                "*.min.css"
                                "*.json"
                                "*.log"))
                     (add-to-list 'grep-find-ignored-files v)))))))
#+end_src


=git grep= is automatically used for grepping in git repository.

Please note =git grep= does NOT use =grep-find-ignored-directories= OR =grep-find-ignored-files=. You could set =eacl-git-grep-untracked= to tell
git whether untracked files should be grepped in the repository.
